Java Socket programming is used for communication between the applications running on different JRE.

Java Socket programming can be connection-oriented or connection-less.

Socket and ServerSocket classes are used for connection-oriented socket programming and DatagramSocket and DatagramPacket classes are used for connection-less socket programming.

The client in socket programming must know two information:

IP Address of Server, and
Port number.
Here, we are going to make one-way client and server communication. 
In this application, client sends a message to the server, server reads the message and prints it.
 Here, two classes are being used: Socket and ServerSocket. 
The Socket class is used to communicate client and server. 
Through this class, we can read and write message. 
The ServerSocket class is used at server-side. 
The accept() method of ServerSocket class blocks the console until the client is connected. 
After the successful connection of client, it returns the instance of Socket at server-side.
